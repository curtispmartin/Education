# ADSChE
New & improved course in applied data science for chemical engineers, w/ an emphasis on pharmaceuticals. 
Written fully in Python, except where applicable. 
Course material is designed to be largely independent & modular, though some content is more fundamental than others.
Such lessons which are marked w/ a plus-sign (+).
Lessons which are important but which are (IMHO) often overlooked are marked w/ an asterisk (*). 

Course is still very much in development. 


## `Lesson: Introduction to Data Science`
Here, we provide a broad overview of the content covered in data science, as well as what will be tackled in this course. 
We also talk about setting up your data science environment. In this course, we'll be using:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

## [`+Lesson: Data Science in Python`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Python)
This lesson will be an extensive introduction to programming in Python. 
While not exhaustive, this lesson will likely require a significant percentage of course time. 
However, we recommend making Python a pre-requisite for the course, & simply reviewing this material.
- [**Lecture 1: An Introduction to Programming**](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Python/1-Programming)
- **Lecture 2: Fundamental Syntax in Python**
- **Lecture 3: ...**

## [`*Lesson: Reproducibility`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Reproducibility)
Here, we discuss best practices when it comes to **doing data science in a reproducible manner.** 
We will introduce the following concepts in reproducibility in this lession: 
- [**Lecture 1: Version Control**](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Reproducibility/2-VersionControl)
- ???

## [`Lesson: Unsupervised Machine Learning`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/UnsupervisedLearning)
Here, we cover the ins & outs of unsupervised machine learning. 
In particular, we will discuss the following:
- **Lecture 1: Overview & Applications**
- **Lecture 2: Dimensionality Reduction**
- [**Lecture 3: Unsupervised Learning**](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/UnsupervisedLearning/3-Clustering)
