# ADSChE
New & improved course in applied data science for chemical engineers. 
Written fully in Python, except where applicable. 
Supplementary materials will be contained w/i "modules", which allow for inclusion/exclusion into course as appropriate.

Breaking the course into distinct modules which can be mixed & matched as desired. 
In general, materials will be divided into four sections: 


## `Heart` 
Lectures in this section will cover `requirements` (i.e. skills & ideas without which we could not do data science). 

### `Lesson: Introduction to Data Science`
Here, we provide a broad overview of the content covered in data science, as well as what will be tackled in this course. 
We also talk about setting up your data science environment. In this course, we'll be using:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

In preparation for next lecture, go ahead & setup your GitHub account & install Git Bash if needed: 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for those on Windows
- ...for those on Mac?

-----


## `Mind` 
Materials in this section will cover `theory` (i.e. concepts which make up the bulk of what we tend to think of as data science).

-----


## `Body` 
Content in this section will cover `enablers` (i.e. things which aren't quite required, but enable modern data science).

### [`Lesson: Version Control`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Body/VersionControl)
Here, we introduce version control as a best practice when writing & developing your code. 
We talk about standard problems in data science when it comes to reproducibility & where version control fits in.
We illustruate how Git & GitHub help solve these problems. 
We discuss best practices in using Git & GitHub. 
We end by covering coding in a collaborative setting. 

-----


## `Soul` 
Lessons in this section will cover `applications` (i.e. the reasons why data science is so important & useful).

-----

Course is still in development. 



### `Lesson: Reproducibility`
Here, we discuss best practices when it comes to writing interpretable code. 


### `Lesson: Data Science in Python`
In this lesson, we introduce various aspects of Python which are helpful for applying data science. 
We also discuss some fundamentals, such as data structures, in the context of Python.
Just as importantly, we begin to introduce various concepts in data science, such as wrangling & visualization.
For those w/o a working knowledge of Python, the Python module (see below) is available for getting up to speed. 


### `Lesson: Data Wrangling`


### `Lesson: Data Visualization`


Requires working understanding of Python. 
See Python Module for crash course which can be incorporated into the curriculum.


## Modules
Here we provide modules for education which can supplement the course but either isn't required or is already a pre-requisite.

Modules in development:
### [Python Module](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Courses/tree/master/Working/Modules/Python)
This module will provide a crash course in programming w/ Python from the ground up. 

### [SQL Module](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Courses/tree/master/Working/Modules/SQL)
This module will provide a crash course in databases & using SQL for relational database management.
