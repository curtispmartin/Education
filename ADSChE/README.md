# ADSChE
New & improved course in applied data science for chemical engineers. 
Written fully in Python, except where applicable. 
Supplementary materials will be contained w/i "modules", which allow for inclusion/exclusion into course as appropriate.

Breaking the course into distinct modules which can be mixed & matched as desired. 
In general, materials will be divided into four sections: 


## `Heart` 
Lectures in this section will cover `requirements` (i.e. skills & ideas without which we could not do data science). 

### `Lesson: Introduction to Data Science`
Here, we provide a broad overview of the content covered in data science, as well as what will be tackled in this course. 
We also talk about setting up your data science environment. In this course, we'll be using:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

-----


## `Mind` 
Materials in this section will cover `theory` (i.e. concepts which make up the bulk of what we tend to think of as data science).

### [`Lesson: Unsupervised Machine Learning`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Mind/UnsupervisedLearning)
Here, we cover the ins & outs of unsupervised machine learning. 
In particular, we will discuss the following:
- `Lecture 1: Overview & Applications`
- `Lecture 2: Dimensionality Reduction`
- [`Lecture 3: Unsupervised Learning`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Mind/UnsupervisedLearning/3_Clustering)

-----


## `Body` 
Content in this section will cover `enablers` (i.e. things which aren't quite required, but enable modern data science).

### [`Lesson: Reproducibility`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Body/Reproducibility)
Here, we discuss best practices when it comes to **doing data science in a reproducible manner.** 
We will introduce the following concepts in reproducibility in this lession: 
- [`Lecture 1: Version Control`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/Body/Reproducibility/VersionControl)
- ??? 

-----


## `Soul` 
Lessons in this section will cover `applications` (i.e. the reasons why data science is so important & useful).

-----

Course is still in development. 



### `Lesson: Data Science in Python`
In this lesson, we introduce various aspects of Python which are helpful for applying data science. 
We also discuss some fundamentals, such as data structures, in the context of Python.
Just as importantly, we begin to introduce various concepts in data science, such as wrangling & visualization.
For those w/o a working knowledge of Python, the Python module (see below) is available for getting up to speed.
