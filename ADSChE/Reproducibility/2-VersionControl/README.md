# [Lecture: Version Control](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AgxFCJc78BuchZlkukSdHpJUAFJoLA?e=wheby4)
Here, we introduce version control as a best practice when writing & developing your code. 
We talk about standard problems in data science when it comes to reproducibility & where version control fits in. 
We illustrate how Git & GitHub help solve these problems. 
We discuss best practices in using Git & GitHub. 
We end by covering coding in a collaborative setting. 

This lecture requires the following to be installed:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Jupyter. Once Miniconda is installed, use `conda install jupyter` in Anaconda Powershell & follow/accept all instructions & prompts. 
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for those on Windows...for those on Mac? Git Bash isn't strictly required, as the Anaconda Powershell can be used instead.

This lecture requires you to set up a GitHub account:
