# [Lecture: Introduction to Programming]
Here, we introduce version control as a best practice when writing & developing your code. 
We talk about standard problems in data science when it comes to reproducibility & where version control fits in. 
We illustrate how Git & GitHub help solve these problems. 
We discuss best practices in using Git & GitHub. 
We end by covering coding in a collaborative setting. 

This lecture requires the following to be installed:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Jupyter needs to be installed. While one can do so by using `conda install jupyter`, I highly recommend creating an environment using the `myenv.yml` file provided here. 
After downloading the file, simply run `conda env create --name myenv --file=myenv.yml`. 
This will ensure you have all the same packages I have! 
You then only need to run `conda activate myenv` to make the packages active.
