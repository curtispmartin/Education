# Lesson 2: Version Control
Here, we introduce version control as a best practice when writing & developing your code. 
We talk about standard problems in data science when it comes to reproducibility & where version control fits in. 
We illustrate how Git & GitHub help solve these problems. 
We discuss best practices in using Git & GitHub. 
We end by covering coding in a collaborative setting.
