# [Lecture: Clustering]((https://1drv.ms/b/s!AgxFCJc78BuchY9Tl2kszwW-q4SRDw?e=8YygNo))
Here, we wrap up our lesson on unsupervised machine learning by discussing clustering algorithms. 
We go through the goals of intentions of clustering. 
We work through multiple clustering algorithms, grouped (tee hee) by type. 
We talk applications & applying these methods yourself in Python
