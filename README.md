## [ADSChE](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE)
New & improved course in applied data science for chemical engineers.
Re-building course to reflect lessons & material learning during previous iterations. 
Goal is to modularize content as much as possible, so as to enable "mixing & matching" of content. 
**Course is very much still in development.**
