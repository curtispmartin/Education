# Education
Repo which houses all materials developed & used for education purposes. 


## [ADSChE](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE)
New & improved course in applied data science for chemical engineers. 
In development. 


## Working
Contains materials currently in development for improved "Data Science in Chemical Engineering" course.
Written fully in Python, except where applicable. 
Core materials will be contained w/i numbered lectures. 
Supplementary materials will be contained w/i "modules", which allow for inclusion/exclusion into course as appropriate (e.g., Python). 


### `Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science`
Here, we provide a broad overview of the content covered in data science, as well as what will be tackled in this course. 
We also talk about setting up your data science environment. In this course, we'll be using:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

In preparation for next lecture, go ahead & setup your GitHub account & install Git Bash if needed: 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for those on Windows
- ...for those on Mac?


### [`Lesson 2: Version Control`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE/2_VersionControl)
Here, we introduce version control as a best practice when writing & developing your code. 
We talk about standard problems in data science when it comes to reproducibility & where version control fits in. 
We illustrate how Git & GitHub help solve these problems. 
We discuss best practices in using Git & GitHub. 
We end by covering coding in a collaborative setting.


### `Lesson 3: Code Interpretability`
Here, we discuss best practices when it comes to writing interpretable code. 


### `Lesson 4: Data Science in Python`
In this lesson, we introduce 

Requires working understanding of Python. 
See Python Module for crash course which can be incorporated into the curriculum.


## Modules
Here we provide modules for education which can supplement the course but either isn't required or is already a pre-requisite.

Modules in development:
### [Python Module](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Courses/tree/master/Working/Modules/Python)
This module will provide a crash course in programming w/ Python from the ground up. 

### [SQL Module](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Courses/tree/master/Working/Modules/SQL)
This module will provide a crash course in databases & using SQL for relational database management.
