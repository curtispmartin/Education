# Education
Repo which houses all materials developed & used for education purposes. 


## [ADSChE](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Education/tree/master/ADSChE)
New & improved course in applied data science for chemical engineers. 
In development. 

Breaking the course into distinct modules which can be mixed & matched as desired. 
In general, will divide into four sections: 
- `Heart:` Requirements (i.e. skills & ideas without which we could not do data science). 
- `Mind:` Theory (i.e. concepts which make up the bulk of what we tend to think of as data science).
- `Body:` Enablers (i.e. things which aren't quite required, but enable modern data science).  
- `Soul:` Applications (i.e. the reasons why data science is so important & useful). 

## Working
Contains materials currently in development for improved "Data Science in Chemical Engineering" course.
Written fully in Python, except where applicable. 
Core materials will be contained w/i numbered lectures. 
Supplementary materials will be contained w/i "modules", which allow for inclusion/exclusion into course as appropriate (e.g., Python).
