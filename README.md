# Courses
Packages together materials I've put together for various data science curriculums over the years.

## Working
Contains materials for "Data Science in Chemical Engineering - v2", currently being developed. 
Written fully in Python, except where applicable. 

### `Lesson 1: Introduction to Data Science`
Here, we provide a broad overview of the content covered in data science, as well as what will be tackled in this course. 
We also talk about setting up your data science environment. In this course, we'll be using:
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

In preparation for next lecture, go ahead & setup your GitHub account & install Git Bash if needed: 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) for those on Windows
- ...for those on Mac?


### [`Lesson 2: Version Control`](https://github.com/curtispmartin/Courses/tree/master/Working/2_VersionControl)
Here, we introduce version control as a best practice when writing & developing your code. 
We talk about standard problems in data science when it comes to reproducibility & where version control fits in. 
We illustrate how Git & GitHub help solve these problems. 
We discuss best practices in using Git & GitHub. 
We end by covering coding in a collaborative setting.


### `Lesson 3: Code Interpretability`
Here, we discuss best practices when it comes to writing interpretable code. 


### `Lesson 4: Introduction to Python -- Part 1`
